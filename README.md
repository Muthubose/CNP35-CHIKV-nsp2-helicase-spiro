# CNP35-CHIKV-nsp2-helicase-spiro
This repository outlines our efforts in the design and development of CHIKV nsP2 helicase inhibitors. North Carolina Central University (NCCU) screened a 50K Asinex library and identified three hits with a common spirocyclic core, demonstrating ATPase IC50 < 20uM. At the Rapidly Emerging Antiviral Drug Discovery Initiative Anti-Viral Drug Discovery Center (READDI-AC), we are involved in hit-to-lead optimization by performing extensive SAR, Physiochemical properties and Photoaffinity labeling studies to confirm the target specificity for the CHIKV nsP2 helicase.
